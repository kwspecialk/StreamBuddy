   - Implemented `handleSearch` function with TMDB API integration
   - Added search useEffect to trigger searches automatically

2. **Enhanced Category System**
   - Categories now use search results when `searchTerm` is present
   - Proper filtering by content type (movie, tv, sport)
   - Safety checks for matches array

3. **Improved Item Handling** 
   - Updated `handleItemClick` to work with search results
   - Added type checking for sports items (`item.type === 'sport'`)
   - Enhanced rendering logic to properly identify stream items

4. **Better Loading States**
   - Separate loading state for search (`searchLoading`)
   - Improved empty state messaging for search vs. no content
   - Fixed loading conditions to not interfere with search

5. **Enhanced User Experience**
   - Updated footer tip to mention search functionality
   - Better empty state messages
   - Consistent behavior between homepage and modal search

## How to Test:

1. **Open StreamBrowserModal**
   - Should load normally with existing content

2. **Test Basic Search**
   - Type in search box - should trigger search automatically
   - Should show loading state while searching
   - Results should appear filtered by current tab

3. **Test Category Filtering**
   - Switch between Live Sports, Movies, TV Shows tabs
   - Search results should filter accordingly
   - Empty search should show original category content

4. **Test Sports Search**
   - Search for team names or sport types
   - Should return matching sports events
   - Clicking should still add streams properly

5. **Test Movie/TV Search**
   - Search for movie or TV show titles
   - Should return TMDB results
   - Clicking should open details modal

## Files Modified:

- `/src/components/StreamBrowserModal.js` - Main functionality added
- All existing functionality preserved - no breaking changes

## Dependencies:

- Uses existing `tmdbApi` for movie/TV search
- Uses existing `matches` prop for sports search
- No new dependencies required

The search functionality in StreamBrowserModal now matches the sophisticated search capabilities of StreamHomepage!
