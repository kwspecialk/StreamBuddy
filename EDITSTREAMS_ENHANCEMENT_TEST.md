# EditStreamsModal Enhancements - Complete Test Guide

## âœ… **Issues Fixed & Features Added**

### **1. Fixed Clear All Button**
**Issue**: Clear All was only removing the last stream instead of all streams
**Solution**: Added dedicated `handleClearAllStreams` function in App.js that properly clears all state

**Testing**:
- Add multiple streams (3-4 streams)
- Open Manage Streams modal
- Click "Clear All" button (bottom right)
- Confirm in the dialog
- âœ… Should clear ALL streams and return to homepage

### **2. Hidden Video Numbers**
**Issue**: Video numbers were always visible on stream players
**Solution**: Numbers now only show when Manage Streams modal is open

**Testing**:
- View streams normally - âœ… no numbers should be visible
- Open Manage Streams modal - âœ… numbers should appear on video players
- Close modal - âœ… numbers should disappear again

### **3. Enhanced Next Episode Button**
**Features Added**:
- âœ… **Smart Season Jumping**: Automatically jumps to Season X Episode 1 when reaching end of season
- âœ… **Episode Validation**: Checks if episodes exist before advancing
- âœ… **Loading States**: Visual feedback during episode advancement
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network errors and missing content
- âœ… **Better Episode Display**: Shows "S01E05" format instead of "TV Show S1E5"

**Testing Next Episode**:
1. **Normal Episode Advance**:
   - Add a TV show stream (e.g., `https://vidsrc.xyz/embed/tv/1399/1-1` for Game of Thrones S1E1)
   - Open Manage Streams modal
   - Click the right arrow button (â†’) next to TV show streams
   - âœ… Should advance to S1E2, then S1E3, etc.

2. **Season Jumping**:
   - Manually navigate to last episode of a season (e.g., S1E10)
   - Click next episode button
   - âœ… Should jump to S2E1 automatically

3. **Loading States**:
   - Click next episode button
   - âœ… Button should show spinning animation while loading
   - âœ… Button should be disabled during loading
   - âœ… Tooltip should show "Loading next episode..."

4. **End of Series Handling**:
   - Navigate to a very high season/episode number
   - Click next episode
   - âœ… Should fail gracefully (check console for "No more episodes available" message)

### **4. Enhanced Clear All Functionality**
**Features**:
- âœ… **Confirmation Dialog**: Prevents accidental clearing
- âœ… **Stream Count Display**: Shows exactly how many streams will be cleared
- âœ… **Proper State Cleanup**: Clears all related state (sourceIndices, retries, etc.)
- âœ… **Auto-Close Modal**: Closes modal after clearing since no streams remain

**Testing Clear All**:
1. Add 3-4 different types of streams (sports, movies, TV shows)
2. Open Manage Streams modal
3. Click "Clear All" button (bottom right, red button with trash icon)
4. âœ… Should show confirmation: "Clear All Streams? This will remove all X streams..."
5. Click "Clear All" in confirmation
6. âœ… Should clear all streams, close modal, return to homepage
7. âœ… All state should be clean (no ghost streams, no old data)

## **Visual Elements to Look For**

- **Disabled state** during operation

### **Clear All Button**:
- ðŸ”´ **Red colored** button with trash icon

### **Episode Titles**:

## **Error Scenarios to Test**

1. **Network Issues**: Try next episode with poor connection
2. **Invalid URLs**: Test with malformed TV show URLs  
3. **Non-existent Episodes**: Try advancing from very high episode numbers
4. **Mixed Content**: Test with combination of sports, movies, and TV shows
5. **Rapid Clicking**: Click next episode button multiple times quickly

## **Technical Implementation Notes**

- **Episode Detection**: Uses regex to parse TV show URLs and extract season/episode info
- **Validation**: Makes HEAD requests to check episode existence before advancing
- **State Management**: Proper loading states prevent race conditions
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful fallbacks for network/parsing errors
- **Performance**: Minimal DOM updates and efficient state management

## **Files Modified**:
- `/src/App.js` - Added clear all function, video number visibility logic
- `/src/components/EditStreamsModal.js` - Enhanced episode advancement, clear all fix
- `/src/components/EditStreamsModal.css` - Added loading states and button styling

All changes are **backward compatible** and don't break existing functionality!
